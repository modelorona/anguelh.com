## How It Works

1. **Identify the Problem Area:** Determine if the issue is related to navigation, content, deployment, or interactive features.
2. **Check Browser Console:** Look for any JavaScript errors or warnings.
3. **Verify Configuration:** Confirm settings in `astro.config.mjs` and constants in `src/consts.ts`.
4. **Inspect Components:** Review relevant Astro components like Header, Footer, and BaseHead for errors.
5. **Examine Integration Points:** Ensure external packages such as Clippy, pdfobject, and MDX integration are correctly installed and loaded.

## Design Guidelines for Troubleshooting Documents

- **Use Clear, Simple Language:** Avoid jargon; focus on actionable advice.
- **Improve Scannability:** Use bullet points, headings, and short paragraphs.

- **Highlight Important Notes:** Use callouts to emphasize critical warnings or tips.

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- Troubleshooting processes respect user data isolation principles and do not require exposure of personal information.
- Sensitive configurations should be handled carefully to prevent leaks during debugging.
- External integrations should be verified for compliance with privacy policies.
