# Open Sudoku

### What is it?

The name speaks for it itself. It comes preloaded with 90 puzzles, and you are able to download more online as well as generate your own.

### Why do I like it?

It is very easy to use and has no distractions. It has a calming effect and I can get lost in it for a good amount of time.

# SimpleLogin

### What is it?

SimpleLogin is an email alias service. It allows you to set a number (unlimited in the paid plan) of aliases that can be disposed of whenever. You are able to respond to emails, and SimpleLogin will forward your response to the sender from your alias. This way, your actual email does not get exposed. It has other features such as custom domain management, multiple email handling, and PGP-based encryption.

### Why do I like it?

This is my first email alias service so I cannot compare it to others. I do appreciate how easy it is to make an alias. I thought it would be a hassle to use it, but after a short while it has become second nature.

### Any issues?

Nope. I do wish the Android app had a bit of a cleaner interface but I enjoy it nonetheless.

# SyncThing

### What is it?

SyncThing is a program that enables continuous file synchronization between devices. It does not require an account to work. There is encryption and authentication between devices, and the program can maintain a file history in case something is accidentally deleted. It is very powerful, and with some work an individual can set up a robust home backup system.

### Why do I like it?

No account is needed. I do like that it is light on resources, and just works.

### Any issues?

None so far.

# Tasks.org

### What is it?

It is an app for keeping track of tasks. A todo-list, if you may. It can synchronize with calendars and Google Tasks, filter and organize by different criteria, and create automatic backups.

### Why do I like it?

The app comes with a lot of features that I do not use but that I am sure others like having. For my basic use case of just creating adhoc daily tasks, it works without a hitch.

### Any issues?

None so far.

# Glider

### What is it?

# Nova Video Player

### What is it?

As the name suggests, Nova is a video player. It can play local as well as network content, comes with hardware acceleration, subtitle support, and automatic video metadata retrieval for movies and TV shows.

### Why do I like it?

I was a user of MX Player for a long time, possibly since its inception. That stopped when it stopped being a video player and started being another outlet to push ads and questionable in-app games and content. Nova does not have this issue.

### Any issues?

None so far.
