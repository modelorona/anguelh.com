# Aegis Authenticator

### What is it?

Aegis authenticator is a 2 factor authenticator application. It lets you import from a variety of other applications including Authy and Google Authenticator. It offers automatic backups, custom account images, and overall simplicity.

### Why do I like it?

I love the automatic backup feature as this was something I wanted from Google Authenticator for a long time. When I had an LG G3, I rooted it and installed a custom recovery with the intention of trying out various ROMS. This meant that backups were paramount, and I was very displeased with Google Authenticator. Ultimately I ended up using Titanium Backup but the sour taste in my mouth was still there.

Additionally, the available backup encryption is nice to have.

### Any issues?

So far, none.

# AntennaPod

### What is it?

AntennaPod is a podcast application. It lets you search and subscribe to any podcast that has an RSS feed and has a straightforward interface. It does not have ads and visual clutter is non-existent.

### Why do I like it?

I like how clean it is. It is easy to search and add new podcasts. Episode scrolling is quick and I love that the information for each episode is not hidden or cluttered. It has the option to download episodes, which has been handy for flights or in areas with bad connectivity.

### Any issues?

I find that going back from a podcast does not take me back to a root screen but instead closes the app. While this does not bother me so, it does throw me off a bit as I expect a home screen for the application. On the upside, it means one less back button to exit the application.

An actual issue with it is the playback controls outside of the application. There is an option to enable persistent controls even when the stream is paused. On more than one occassion, the control notification does not disappear even when swiped or force closed, and this is very irritating. I would suggest the Spotify approach, where the controls are there when the song is paused but can be swiped away.

# F-Droid

### What is it?

F-Droid is a digital catalogue of free and open-source applications. In essence, it is an alternative to Google Play with the noticeable difference that applications within it must be free and open-source, free of proprietary trackers, analytics, and ads, and be built without Google's play services. More information can be found on the [Inclusion Policy page](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Inclusion_Policy/).

### Why do I like it?

I like having an alternative to the Google Play store. The client application is easy to use, and I like seeing more experimental or research-led applications. It reminds me of the early days of the Android marketplace when apps were not trying to buy my attention or track me in every possible way. Additionally, I appreciate applications without ads (crazy, I know).

### Any issues?

Currently, none.

# Bitwarden

### What is it?

Bitwarden is a password manager. Nothing more to it.

### Why do I like it?

The free personal plan is incredibly generous and lets me have an unlimited amount of saved passwords. It comes with a password generator with configurable length and characters. The paid plans offer password checks, multi-factor authentication, and encrypted file attachments.

The Android application is flawless. It does offer the ability to auto-fill passwords by using the accessibility services, but that is something I will not enable so I cannot say how effective it is.

I do pay for it as I like the service and want to see it continue.

### Any issues?

Currently, none.

# Bromite

### What is it?

Bromite is a browser forked from Chromium. It comes with ad-blocking and privacy protections and is meant to provide a fast browsing experience with minimal interruptions.

### Why do I like it?

I love that it blocks ads. The interface is just like the Chrome for Android interface except that it feels cleaner and does not take up so much room. It feels much faster as well. I have had no issue with websites or site scripts. It's a wonderful alternative to Chrome for Android.

### Any issues?

None at the moment.

# Etar

### What is it?

Etar is a calendar application. It is designed to be straightforward and fast. It comes with no ads or trackers. It uses the Android calendar sync, so it is able to instantly import any accounts you have on your device. Additionally, it can sync to CalDAV calendars.

### Why do I like it?

I previously used Samsung calendar. While it was okay, its sync was horrendous and I missed events. I was also wary of Samsung having the option to observe my calendar data, as some of it is quite personal (ironically, I do not self-host). Etar has no sync issues and has been very snappy.

### Any issues?

None so far.

# FairEmail

### What is it?

It is an email client that supports a lot of providers like Gmail and Outlook as well as the standard mail protocols. It is quite simply one of the best open source applications I have ever used and comes with a breadth of features. It can auto-sync, do text search within accounts, remove images and links, show outgoing links, encrypt and decrypt, and much more.

### Why do I like it?

Words are not enough to describe how much I love this application. Previously, I used the Gmail + Outlook applications. Gmail was stuttering and sluggish while Outlook was okay but drained battery. My phone is not a mid or low range device (Samsung S10e) and there is no reason for an application that just displays _text and images_ to be so slow. FairEmail has blown these two out of the water. There is no noticeable battery drain, no sluggishness, and I love the simple animation-free interface.

### Any issues?

Nope. Happy with it.

Part 2 will follow shortly. I have split the content into two posts so as to keep them shorter and cleaner.
