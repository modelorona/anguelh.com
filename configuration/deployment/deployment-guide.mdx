# Deployment Guide

Welcome to the Deployment Guide for your Astro-powered personal website. This guide provides you with clear, actionable steps to deploy and host your website efficiently and reliably on modern platforms.

## Purpose & Positioning

Deploying your website with confidence is essential to delivering a fast, secure, and accessible experience to your visitors. This guide helps you understand how to configure, build, and launch your Astro site using Netlify, with seamless integration for smart features like sitemap generation and SEO-friendly robots.txt. Maximize your site's reach and performance with minimal setup.

## Why Use This Deployment Guide

- **Streamline your deployment process:** Follow a proven, step-by-step approach tailored to Astro and Netlify.
- **Automatic SEO optimization:** Ensure your site includes up-to-date sitemaps and robots.txt for better search engine crawlability.
- **Robust build configuration:** Benefit from a consistent build setup that incorporates MDX support and edge-ready deployment.
- **Easy scalability:** Host on Netlify with support for serverless functions and continuous deployment.
- **Maintain control:** Customize deployment and sitemap rules effortlessly without manual overhead.

## Key Features of this Deployment Integration

- **Astro configuration with Netlify adapter:** Automates deployment packaging and delivery optimized for Netlify’s serverless environment.
- **Dynamic Sitemap generation:** Automatically creates a sitemap.xml including both static pages and dynamically discovered blog posts.
- **Robots.txt generation:** Configure crawler directives to control search engine access, improving SEO management.
- **Built-in MDX support:** Enable your content to include React components seamlessly in Markdown files.
- **File system scanning:** Automatically detect blog post URLs for comprehensive sitemap entries.

## How It Works

1. **Setup Configuration:**
   - Your `astro.config.mjs` file contains all deployment settings, including the site URL, output directory, and integrations like MDX, sitemap, and robots.txt.

2. **Discovery of Blog Content:**
   - On build, the system scans the `src/content/blog` folder to find all blog files.
   - It maps blog post filenames to URL paths for sitemap inclusion.

3. **Generate Outputs:**
   - The build outputs static assets optimized for fast delivery.
   - Sitemap and robots.txt files are dynamically generated to reflect the current site state.

4. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Using the `@astrojs/netlify` adapter, your site deploys seamlessly to the Netlify platform with CDN, edge functions, and continuous integration support.

5. **Post-Deployment:**
   - The site is live at your configured URL with SEO enhancements.
   - Future content changes trigger rebuilds and redeployments automatically if connected to your Git provider.

## Getting Started: Deploy Your Site

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure your Site URL and Settings">

Update the `site` property in `astro.config.mjs` to your live URL.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';
import robotsTxt from 'astro-robots-txt';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://yourdomain.com',
  output: 'server',
  adapter: netlify(),
  integrations: [
    mdx(),
    sitemap({
      hostname: 'https://yourdomain.com',
      // additional options
    }),
    robotsTxt(),
  ],
});
```

</Step>

<Step title="Build Your Site">

Run the build command to generate your static assets and server files:

```bash
npm run build
```

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Netlify">

Connect your repository to Netlify or manually deploy the output folder generated during build (`dist/`). Netlify will handle hosting, CDN, and serverless functions.

</Step>

<Step title="Verify Your Deployment">

Visit your site's URL to confirm deployment. Check `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` to ensure they reflect your latest content and crawling rules.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Next Steps

- **Explore Site Configuration:** Customize deployment settings in [`Site Configuration`](site-configuration.md).
- **Add Blog Posts:** Learn how to create and manage blog posts at [`Creating & Managing Blog Posts`](creating-managing-blog-posts.md).
- **Optimize SEO:** Adjust robots.txt and sitemap behavior through [`Privacy Policies`](adding-editing-privacy-policies.md).

## Design Guidelines

- **Keep deployment configuration declarative and centralized** in `astro.config.mjs`.
- **Follow consistent naming and folder structure** for content to enable automatic URL and sitemap generation.
- **Leverage Netlify’s serverless capabilities** for enhanced performance.
- **Test your sitemap and robots.txt regularly** to maintain SEO health.

## Security & Privacy

- No user data is processed during deployment.
- The robots.txt file controls crawler access to pages, protecting sensitive content if configured accordingly.
- Hosting on Netlify benefits from platform security and CDN protections.
